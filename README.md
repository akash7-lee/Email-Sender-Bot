Automatic Resume Sender (MERN + Python)

This project helps job seekers automatically send their resumes to recruiters using two different approaches:

MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) – A full-stack web application where users upload their resume, enter recruiter emails, and send resumes from the browser.

Python Automation Script – A simple command-line tool that automatically sends your resume using Gmail SMTP.

You can use any one or both in your workflow.
